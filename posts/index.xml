      <description>HAProxy is a very powerful load balancer and reverse proxy. Honestly, I have not given it the time of day since the ol&amp;rsquo; days (when Nginx was the one to beat) and since then have grown to prefer Traefik. Traefik is simple to set up, versatile when you need it to be and its ubiquity is unmatched. It is even built into K3s!
Speaking of K3s, I currently run two Kubernetes clusters in my homelab both leveraging K3s and Traefik.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: Set this alias to save up to 90% in the CLI! /s On a serious note, set this and check out kubectl completion and aliases.
Beautiful town!
The San Diego Convention Center is a behemoth and getting lost was a daily occurrence.
I am sure I was not the only one who was overwhelmed by the sheer size of the event as there were 12,000 other souls on this starship.</description>
